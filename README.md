# [pdf-page-stripper](https://fsinf.github.io/pdf-page-stripper/)

Strips useless stuff from TU Vienna PDFs. [View it online here](https://fsinf.github.io/pdf-page-stripper/)

Essentially it goes through every single slide, and removes those that are redundant duplicates.

Other useful software for the TU Vienna can be found [here](https://wiki.fsinf.at/wiki/Useful_Software).

## Developer Information

Clone the repo, run `npm install` and then run `npm run dev` and you should be good to go.
